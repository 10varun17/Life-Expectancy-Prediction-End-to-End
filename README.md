<h1> Predicting Life Expectancy with Machine Learning Model </h1>

It is an end-to-end Machine Learning project. I have used the [Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data) dataset from kaggle.</br>

<h2>Quick Summary of the dataset:</h2> </br>

The data was collected from World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN). The dataset includes data for each country from year 2000 to 2015. It has 2938 rows and 22 columns. The feature
variables have been divided into categories like immunization related factors, mortality factors, economical factors, and social factors.</br>

<h2>Project Description:</h2> </br>
It is an end-to-end project, which means that it has every steps of building an ML model. This project includes steps like downloading the data, exploring the data, processing the data for ML algorithms, selecting 
and training different models with cross-validation, fine-tuning the models, and evaluating the final model on the test set. It mostly uses Scikit-Learn. This project considers and compares three models:
Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The performance measure chosen for this prject is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
